	<h1>About Kubetoy 1.4.0</h1>
	
	<p>This application is a simple Node.js application that is expected to run in a
	container deployed by kubernetes.  It was created to help explore IBM Cloud Private
	by allowing the user to write messages to the log, crash the application, and even
	create and view files in a shared file system.</p>
	
	<p>This version makes the filessystem features optional.  This enables it to be deployed
	to systems without persistent storage.</p>
	
	<p>This app uses Bootstrap 4.  All the files have been copied locally to this
	application so Internet connectivity is not required and can work in 
	an air-gapped system.</p>
	
	<p>New for version 1.3 is the page to explore config maps and secrets</p>
	<p>New for version 1.4 is ability to write to stderr (error log)</p>
	
	<p>The app was written by jim conallen (jconallen@us.ibm.com) and is made available under
	the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.</p>
